# PL3231 Research: On Career Success: Regulatory Focus and the Moderating Influence of Optimism and Stress

This research was conducted as part of an Individual Research project with the NUS Situated Goal Pursuit Lab, headed by Dr Jia Lile and mentored by Ong Hee Seng.

Correlation and moderation analysis through ANCOVA was done using R. This study examined the effects of promotion and prevention-based regulatory focus on career success, moderated by optimism and stress. 

This study points to the importance of moderators like optimism and stress in the effectiveness of regulatory focus interventions. Regulatory focus interventions aim to change the strategy adopted by individuals in working towards their goals. The decision on whether to employ a promotion or prevention intervention should take into account individual capacity to adopt the strategy and traits of individuals that can influence the effectiveness of the strategy.
